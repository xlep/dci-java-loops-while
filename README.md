# While loops in Java

## Tasks

### Basic loops
Create while loops to achieve the following requirements:

* Print the text "Hello World!" exactly 6 times.
* Start with the number 3 and double it. Double the result until it exceeds 100.
* Count down from 10 (include 0).

### Advanced Examples
* Replace all vowels of a String with * by evaluating each letter with a Matcher.
* Calculate and print all prime numbers from 1 to 100
** Note: a prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 (with an even result). e.g. 1,2,3 but not 4 since 4 / 2 is
  
   The modulo operator ( % ) will return the "remainder" of a division (https://www.baeldung.com/modulo-java)
